# vggnet
Implementation of VGGnet 16  in CUDA.

#Summary:
The project implements VGGnet 16 for object classification in CUDA framwork. The application takes a 224*224 RGB image in text format and Keras weights as the input to predict the object's classification. 

#Credits:
The Project refers the source code and the python scripts provided by github user ZFTurbo
